> _Answer:_ Yes

**Question:** Did you have fun playing this game?
> _Answer:_ Yes

**Question:** During gameplay what problems or issues seemed to happen and how did you get them to reoccur?
> _Answer:_ An issue I had with this game was whenever I use a character away from the home lot (i.e. at work), the characters on the home lot will not take care of their needs (mainly hunger and bladder). The game should and did auto-set their actions to "care for self" but it did not register properly. Many others have reported this issue and the developers have classified the fix as a workaround but it is not completely resolved.
