**Question:** During gameplay what problems or issues seemed to happen and how did you get them to reoccur?
> _Answer:_ The movement in the game was slightly off. Sometimes when trying to complete a mission or class, the cursor would not move properly and caused an issue in the completion of the mission. I couldn't figure out a fix or workaround so I assume that it's just a bug that wasn't found during testing.
