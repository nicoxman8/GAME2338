## Summary
_New Super Mario Bros._ is a side-scrolling platformer starring Mario and Luigi in an attempt to rescue Princess Peach from Bowser and his son Bowser Jr. by travelling through 8 different worlds. The intro of the game shows Mario and Peach strolling through the Mushroom Kingdom when they see a cloud form over Princess Peach's Castle and strike the castle with lightning. Mario runs towards the castle but the cloud disappears before he gets to it. He stops, turns around, and sees Bowser Jr. kidnap Peach and runs away. Mario chases after them but off-screen, there's a loud crash and a triple beep sound. Bowser Jr. then runs off in the other direction with Mario chasing after, revealing that the triple beep sound was Mario shrinking into his standard form.

This game is the newer version of another game called _Super Mario Bros._ and is 2.5 dimensional whereas the older version is 2 dimensional. The player can play as either Mario or Luigi but to play as Luigi a certain action has to be taken. The player may play as Luigi at any time but the action needed to play as Luigi is only revealed after the player completes the game. The difference between the two character's is that Luigi jumps higher but Mario stops quicker (will not slide into enemies or off-stage). The game features power-ups from the previous games as well as some new ones. The returning power-ups consist of the Super Mushroom to make Mario grow, the Fire Flower so throw fireballs at enemies, the Starman to make Mario temporarily invincible, and the 1-Up to give Mario an extra life. The new power-ups consist of the Blue Koopa Shell to give Mario the shell dash power, the Mega Mushroom to temporarily make Mario a giant, and the Mini Mushroom to make Mario tiny.

Throughout the game, the player will find large coins with a star on them; these are Star Coins. There are three Star Coins to collect in each level. They are required to open up areas to a Toad House. Depending on the color of the house, the player can either earn a power-up, 1-Ups, or a Mega Mushroom. This game also features a multiplayer mode and minigames that can either be played alone or with others through DS Download Play. In multiplayer mode, two people play as Mario and Luigi and have to collect stars hidden throughout various different stages. The players can attack each other ans steal each other's stars. The player with the most stars at the end wins.

## Final Thoughts
I like this about the game but didn't like this particular feature. This should be at a minimum of one paragraph.
