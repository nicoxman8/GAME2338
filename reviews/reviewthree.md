### Rating

## Summary
_Dude, Stop_ is a puzzle game where the goal of the game is to "make everyone hate you." This game features a series of puzzles in the form of packs. As a narrator tries to help the player (Test Subject #17) pass each puzzle pack, the player is presented with  of a bet he made. This game allows the player to pass the puzzles by doing the right things or the wrong things (such as littering). Some packs, however, will not let the player progress unless they do both. The first puzzle is the only puzzle that requires the player to do the wrong things to progress. The player may also do a puzzle pack again to try the other way or earn a special or secret trophy.

This game features many real-life situations that may irritate people. Whether it's washing whites with colors, taking pictures of food, or even leaving a lego piece on the floor. After every puzzle, the narrator will award the player with a trophy. In order for the player to earn a trophy, they must get at least 80% of the puzzles done as "a monster" or "a good guy". 100% will give the player another trophy as a bonus (the narrator does not mention this trophy).

The narrator mentions that if the player keeps failing the puzzles, he will activate D.U.C.K., an unfinished project that will not allow the player to fail anymore. After failing the puzzles in pack 7 the narrator will activate D.U.C.K. However, as it is unfinished, the player will still be allowed to fail puzzles and it will cause issues with the test because it is unstable. The game features a very humorous narrative along with the text that appears after a puzzle is completed. Throughout the game the player will find hidden jigsaw puzzle pieces which, if all are collected, will unlock a special level after the game is completed. This puzzle can also be done good and bad.

## Final Thoughts
_Dude, Stop_ is an excellent game! I very much enjoy the humor and narration that was put into this game. The trophies that are available for completing a specific task in the puzzle packs is a great way to keep the player engaged. I played this game when it was still just a demo and I enjoy the twist they put on the game, where the D.U.C.K. is "the bad guy". They implemented a story element in the game rather than just making it a typical puzzle game. I look forward to seeing what the developers create in the future.
