### Rating
I would rate this game a 5/5 stars.

## Summary
Dude, Stop is a puzzle game where the goal of the game is to "make everyone hate you." The game features a series of puzzles and a narrator trying to help the player (Test Subject #17) pass them because of a bet he made. The game allows the player to pass the puzzles by doing the right thing but others will not let them progress unless they do the wrong thing (such as wearing socks with sandals). They player may also do the puzzles again to get a special or secret trophy.

This game features many real-life situations that may irritate people. Whether it's washing whites with colors, taking pictures of food, or even leaving a lego piece on the floor. After every puzzle, the narrator will award the player with a trophy. In order for the player to earn a trophy, they must get at least 80% of the puzzles done as "a monster" or "a good guy". 100% will give the player another trophy as a bonus 
## Final Thoughts
I like this about the game but didn't like this particular feature. This should be at a minimum of one paragraph.
