## Summary
_You Have to Win the Game_ is a Free-To-Play 2D exploration platform game developed and published by Minor Key Games. The player plays as what appears to be a child and has to explore the ruins of a lost world to find the portal to win the game. The style of the game features a vintage PC aesthetic along with monotonic sounds. The game has multiple sectors, each one with a unique and sometimes humorous name (such as You Have To Start The Game). The player will eventually enter areas and find an orb on a pedestal. These orbs, when touched, will unlock an ability that will help the player. They are required to complete the game.

In the game, the player will search various areas, some of which contain treasure which is required to complete the game with 100% progress but not required to win the game. If completed with 100% progress, the player will earn an achievement called You Have to 100% the Game. Some treasure cannot be acquired until a certain ability is unlocked and some are hidden within certain areas of the game. The game contains enemies, some large and some small. Unlike most games, these enemies cannot be defeated but instead should be avoided at all costs. Some areas contain large enemies that will shoot the player in a particular pattern. As long as the player learns the pattern, they can get past these enemies.

The player does not have a finite amount of lives but they do have the ability to die. The game has checkpoints placed in many areas throughout the game that will restart the player at the checkpoint if they do die. There are 2 other modes to play where the player does have a finite amount of lives. YOLO mode where the player has only 1 life and cat mode where the player has 9 lives and plays as a white cat. In order to beat YOLO mode, the player has to not die at all. There is also a mode called Extra Spicy which is a remixed version of the original campaign and is much more difficult. The abilities are also collected in a different order due to the areas that are accessible at the time.

## Final Thoughts
_You Have to Win the Game_ is a very enjoyable game and I really enjoy the simplicity of it. I also enjoy the humorous sector names that are included. One thing I did not enjoy about this game is the treasure and artifact placement. I do enjoy how they were hidden in some areas, but I don't enjoy how they were hidden. One of them was hidden at the start of the game and blended in with the leaves on the tree. It is almost impossible to see. However, the game overall is very entertaining.
