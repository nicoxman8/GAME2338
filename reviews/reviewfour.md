## Summary
_You Have to Win the Game_ is a Free-To-Play 2D exploration platform game developed and published by Minor Key Games. The player plays as what appears to be a child and has to explore the ruins of a lost world to find the portal to win the game. The style of the game features a vintage PC aesthetic along with monotonic sounds. The game has multiple sectors, each one with a unique name (such as You Have To Start The Game). The player will eventually enter areas and find an orb on a pedestal. These orbs, when touched, will unlock an ability that will help the player. They are required to complete the game.

In the game, the player will search various areas, some of which contain treasure which is required to complete the game with 100% progress but not required to win the game. If completed with 100% progress, the player will earn an achievement called You Have to 100% the Game. Some treasure cannot be acquired until a certain ability is unlocked and some are hidden within certain areas of the game. The game contains enemies, some large and some small.
