### Rating
I give this game 5/5 stars.

## Summary
_Wii Music_ is a music focused game developed by Nintendo in which the player can play music ranging from songs as simple as "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" to more complex songs such as "Super Mario Bros." The player has an option to choose which character they play as; these are called Miis. In Jam Mode, the player can either choose Quick Jam where the stage, instrument, song, part, and genre are randomized or Custom Jam where they choose everything manually. There are 6 parts to the band; melody, harmony, chord, bass, and percussion which has 2 slots available. The player may choose which part to play while the other parts are played by tiny characters called tutes (although they can remove them or play each part themselves). Afterwards the player can restart, watch a replay, save a video, or return to the main menu.

When playing a song, depending on the instrument chosen, the player must make a motion or press buttons to play (such as strumming a guitar or playing a flute). Some buttons can alter how the instrument plays. There is also an option to bring up a music sheet which tells the player when to play a note. If the player chooses to save a video, they first have to rate the video from 0-100 points. Then they must design a jacket for their song (as if it were to be on a CD). Then they can watch the video; they are saved in the music library. The player can also replay the song using a different part. The part they played before is saved and the character they used for that part becomes an AI (artificial intelligence). There are also tutorials to help the player learn different genres such as Rock, Jazz, or even Classical. These help to unlock new instruments, stages, and genres in Jam Mode. There is also a tutorial called "Expand Your Style" unlocked later in the game.

_Wii Music_ also has minigames. These consist of Mii Maestro, Pitch Perfect, and Handbell Harmony. In Mii Maestro, the player chooses a Mii to play as and a composition to conduct. Once the game starts, they must raise their baton to get the choir's attention then swing the Wii Remote like a conductor baton to make the choir play the composition chosen. The harder the Wii Remote is swung the louder the music plays. Pitch Perfect plays like a music quiz. The player gets a question such as "Which Mii is playing the wrong note?" Then based on what they hear, they must click and drag the correct Mii(s) onto the platform. Completing these unlocks new songs for the player. Handbell Harmony plays in a similar manner to Jam mode. The player chooses a song and which handbells to use as each has a different pitch and parts. They may also choose the easy, medium, or hard difficulty. Then, following the on-screen guide, they swing the Wii Remote and Nunchuk to play the bells.

## Final Thoughts
_Wii Music_ is a really fun game. I enjoy it very much and the minigames are very entertaining. Being able to play instruments in such an immersive way is a really good idea and I adore that feature. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys music as much as I do. Also the jacket designing feature when saving a video enriches the game further. It sprouts creativity. _Wii Music_ seems to be one of the best music focused games out there.
