## Summary
_Yoshi's Island DS_ takes place many years before Super Mario and his brother Luigi became the heroes of the Mushroom Kingdom. In this game, evil villains called Toadies led by the evil magikoopa, Kamek, were kidnapping babies all around the world including Baby Mario; Baby Luigi; Baby Wario; Baby Peach, and Baby Donkey Kong. A stork came to try and rescue them but was only able to save Baby Mario and Baby Peach. Baby Mario landed in Yoshi Island and was found by dinosaurs called Yoshisaurs (commonly known as Yoshis). The Yoshis go on a quest with Baby Mario, the stork, and other babies they find to rescue Baby Luigi and all the other babies that were kidnapped.

_Yoshi's Island DS_ is a sequel to the game for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES), Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island. This game was made for the Nintendo DS as a sequel. The playable characters in this game consist of the residents of Yoshi Island as well as Baby Mario; Baby Peach; Baby Donkey Kong, and Baby Bowser who turns out to be the villain in the end. In the original game, Baby Mario was the only playable character. Baby Bowser lured the babies and Yoshis into his castle where all the babies were being held, revealing that he was the one who kidnapped them. After defeating Baby Bowser, adult Bowser shows up from the future to defeat Baby Mario so that he never becomes the hero of the Mushroom Kingdom and he can finally kidnap Princess Peach for good.

Each of the playable characters in this game has a unique ability. Baby Mario can make M Blocks found throughout the levels tangible and provides stepping stones in order to progress and also prrovides a speed boost for Yoshis. Baby Peach has a parasol that can help Yoshis flutter higher and further and also catches wind currents to be able to float across large gaps. Baby Donkey Kong is able to climb vines and chains and has a unique attack called DK Dash Attack which can defeat most enemies in the game. Baby Wario carries a magnet that can attract coins (even through walls) and can move Magnett Blocks and Magnet Platforms. Baby Bowser can breathe fire at enemies but Yoshis will not be able to swallow enemies to make eggs (used for their projectile attack) while carrying him and instead use his fireballs as the equivalent. The stork appears at Stork Stops and allows the player to switch to the appropriate baby for the task.
