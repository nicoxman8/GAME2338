## Details

### Game Title
_Yoshi's Island DS_, https://www.gamestop.com/ds/games/yoshis-island-ds/61610

### Rating
I would give this game a 4/5 star rating.

## Summary
_Yoshi's Island DS_ takes place many years before Super Mario and his brother Luigi became the heroes of the Mushroom Kingdom. In this game, a stork was delivering babies to the parents but it was attacked by evil villains called magikoopas. The stork was able to send all the babies away in bubbles except for baby Luigi who was kidnapped. Baby Mario landed in Yoshi's Island and was found by dinosaurs called Yoshisaurs (commonly known as Yoshis).

## Final Thoughts
I like this about the game but didn't like this particular feature. This should be at a minimum of one paragraph.
