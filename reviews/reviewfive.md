### Rating
I would give this game a 4/5 star rating.

## Summary
_Yoshi's Island DS_ takes place many years before Super Mario and his brother Luigi became the heroes of the Mushroom Kingdom. In this game, evil villains called Magikoopas were kidnapping babies all around the world including Baby Mario; Baby Luigi; Baby Peach, and Baby Donkey Kong. A stork came to try and rescue them but was only able to save Baby Mario and Baby Peach. Baby Mario landed in Yoshi Island and was found by dinosaurs called Yoshisaurs (commonly known as Yoshis). The Yoshis go on a quest with Baby Mario (and other babies they find) to rescue Baby Luigi.

_Yoshi's Island DS_ is a sequel to the game for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES), Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island. This game was made for the DS as a sequel. The playable characters in this game consist of the residents of Yoshi Island as well as Baby Mario; Baby Peach; Baby Donkey Kong, and Baby Bowser who turns out to be the villain in the end. Baby Bowser lured the babies and Yoshis into his castle where Baby Luigi was being held, revealing that he was the one who kidnapped him.
