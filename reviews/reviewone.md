### Rating
4/5 stars

## Summary
  This game puts the player in the role of Kyle Crane; an undercover agent for the Global Relief Effort (GRE). They are sent to infiltrate a quarantine zone, Harran, but are encountered by zombies and later a sadistic governor named Kadir "Rais" Suleiman. The game features lots of parkour features which can be upgraded as the player levels up.
  The day and night cycle of the game plays a big part in the story of the game. At nighttime, the most dangerous zombies will appear and pursue the player on sight. They will retreat during the daytime as they are "allergic" to ultraviolet rays.
  The side quests of the game provide extra entertainment and something to do if a mission is too difficult. The player can do those is the meantime which will also help to gain EXP to unlock more skills. These skills can help to pass the main story missions.

## Final Thoughts
One particular thing I didn't enjoy about this game is the supply and weapon location limitations. One area of the game has many weapons around but not much supplies. The other area has lots of supplies around but very few weapons. This makes survival very difficult.
