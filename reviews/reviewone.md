### Rating
4/5 stars

## Summary
  This game puts the player in the role of Kyle Crane; an undercover agent for the Global Relief Effort (GRE). They are sent to infiltrate a quarantine zone, Harran, but are encountered by zombies and later a sadistic governor named Kadir "Rais" Suleiman. The game features lots of parkour features which can be upgraded as the player levels up.
  

This game is about... this should be at least 3-4 paragraphs summarising the gameplay mechanics of the game. You should be answering the who, what, when, where, why, and how of the game itself.

## Final Thoughts
I like this about the game but didn't like this particular feature. This should be at a minimum of one paragraph.
