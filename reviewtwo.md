### Rating
I give Papers, Please a 3/5 star rating.

## Summary
This game is set in the early 1980's and the player takes the role of an immigration officer in the fictional country of Arstotzka. Arstotzka is at hostilities with it's neighboring countries, such as Kolechia, during this period. The player starts off in a class 8 dwelling with their wife, son, uncle, and mother-in-law. As they progress through the game, they may move to a higher class residence.

The player must follow the instructions given before each level starts and find any discrepancies that may be found on the documents they recieve. If any are found, they must stamp a denial on the passport or denial slip unless the dicrepancy is cleared (i.e. fingerprints). If none are found, they must stamp an approval. If anybody is let through that has an uncleared discrepancy, the player will recieve a penalty. They are allowed 2 warnings before their payment is penalized.

Papers, Please has 20 different endings. The player must get a good ending in order to recieve the code to gain access to endless mode.
